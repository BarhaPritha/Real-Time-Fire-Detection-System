# Real-Time-Fire-Detection-System
This is a software-based project and it aims to develop a system to detect fire using smoke, temperature and humidity sensors along with Arduino microcontroller. Our main concern is the household environment and the sensors used are applicable to be used in kitchen. Whenever the amount of smoke or temperature reaches too high and the sensors detect an unusual condition, it will buzz a sound and show a red light to notify the fire attack. This way it alerts people of fire and protects them from being attacked by it. 

The components that we used to execute the project are given below:
• Arduino UNO
• MQ-2 smoke detection sensor
• Temperature sensor
• Humidity sensor
• Buzzer
• 5 mm LED light (red and green color)
• 1 kilo ohm resistor
